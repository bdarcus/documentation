formatting of citations, notes and bibliographies, offering:

-   An open format
-   Compact and robust styles
-   Extensive support for style requirements
-   Automatic style localization
-   Infrastructure for style distribution and updating
-   Thousands of freely available styles (Creative Commons BY-SA
    licensed)
