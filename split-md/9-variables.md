      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"expanded\"

:   Abbreviated page ranges are expanded to their non-abbreviated form:
    42 -- 45, 321 -- 328, 2787 -- 2816

\"minimal\"

:   All digits repeated in the second number are left out: 42 -- 5, 321

[^1]: The presence of uncited entries in the bibliography can make cites
    in the document ambiguous. To make sure such cites are
    disambiguated, the CSL processor should create hidden \"ghost\"
    cites for all uncited bibliographic entries and include them in the
    disambiguation process.
